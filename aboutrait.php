<p align="justify" style= "width:80%; line-height:1.6; font-size:16px;">Over the past few decades, we are witnessing  remarkable advances and explosive growth of new technologies that are changing  the world very fast. 
  Information Technology (IT) sector is indeed playing a  significant role in facing the technological challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>  century. 
  The impact of IT on every sphere of human activities is stupendous  these days. This field has been playing vital role in our economical, social  and rural growth. 
  The change in Information Technology is racing by the hour  with a new idea emerging at every small span of time.
   The eastern region of our  country has tremendous potential for the growth of mining, metallurgical and  mineral industries.
    It is felt that there is a strong need to give a new  dimension in our efforts to catch up the rapid strides being made in technology.
    </p><p style="width:80%; font-size:16px;  line-height:1.6;text-align:justify;">  Therefore, it has been thought in greater interest to bring together all  IT/Computer Professionals, Researchers, Academicians, Industry People and  valued users on a common platform to discuss the current state-of-art in IT and  its role in the global scenario.
     With this thought, the Department of Computer  Science &amp; Engineering, ISM conducted two National Level Seminars on Recent  Advances on Information Technology, namely &ldquo;RAIT-2007&rdquo; and &ldquo;RAIT-2009&rdquo; (sequel  to RAIT-2007) in year 2007 and 2009 respectively.
      After the huge success of  these two events, the department had decided to pull up RAIT series at global level and organised 1<sup>st</sup> IEEE International Conference on "Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT-2012)" followed by RAIT-2014. Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT-2016) was the 3<sup>rd</sup> IEEE International
       Conference that has been conceived with multi-disciplinary areas in IT, Computers, Electronics together with application areas of Mineral, Services, Telecom sectors that are strategically important for the overall economic growth of our country. RAIT-2018 is a step forward in this direction.
     </p><p style="width:80%; font-size:16px;  line-height:1.6; text-align:justify;"> The vision  of the conference is to provide awareness about the recent advances in the Information  and Communication technology, through tutorial, keynote addresses and  pre-reviewed research paper presentations.
     The conference will also serve as an  excellent platform for all the participants to share their views and ideas.  Another endeavor of this conference is to collate and present the latest  development in IT/Computer along with realistic assessment of the current  status and trends.</p>
